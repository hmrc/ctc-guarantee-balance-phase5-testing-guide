# CTC Guarantee Balance API phase 5 testing guide

Learn how to test the compatibility of your software with New Computerised Transit System phase 5 (NCTS5) and [CTC Guarantee Balance API v2.0](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-guarantee-balance/2.0).

[Learn about key NCTS5 dates](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-tis/#ncts5-key-dates).

## Before you start

When you are ready to test your software, first read and understand the [CTC Guarantee Balance API phase 5 service guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/ctc-guarantee-balance-phase5-service-guide/).

### Scheduling your testing

Before the UK NCTS5 goes live, you will need to check that your software is compatible with both it and CTC Guarantee Balance API v2.0. This involves using test scenarios and predefined test data.

### Trader Test

Trader Test is a test environment that simulates both automated responses and real-life NCTS experience. This includes the Guarantee Management System (GMS) against which you will be able to run your tests.

For information about accessing the NCTS5 Trader Test environment, see [CTC Traders API phase 5 testing guide](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-testing-guide/#accessing-trader-test). 

### Testing prerequisites

For information about actions that must be completed before testing, see the quick start section of the [CTC Guarantee Balance API phase 5 service guide](/guides/ctc-guarantee-balance-phase5-service-guide/#quick-start).

### UK cutover from NCTS4 to NCTS5

After the NCTS5 service goes live, there will be an NCTS4 to NCTS5 cutover period that will affect in-flight and newly created transit declarations. For information about this, see [CTC Traders API phase 5 testing guide](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-testing-guide/#uk-cutover-from-ncts4-to-ncts5).

The cutover period will not affect [CTC Guarantee Balance API v1.0](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-guarantee-balance/1.0) or CTC Guarantee Balance API v2.0. Instead, guarantees will be migrated from NCTS4 to NCTS5 while the UK NCTS4 service is still running, and the NCTS4 service will be used for any guarantee balance check calls to the GMS for the duration of the cutover period.

After the cutover period ends, the UK NCTS5 service will be used for all guarantee balance check calls to the GMS.

The order in you which you might read these documents can depend on whether you have previous NCTS experience. The following table recommends 2 possible reading orders but you can read the documents in any order you want.

| Suggested reading order | New NCTS users | NCTS4 users migrating to NCTS5 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Roadmap | Service guide |
| 2 | Service guide | Technical interface specification |
| 3 | Technical interface specification | Reference |
| 4 | Reference | Testing guide |
| 5 | Testing guide | Roadmap |

**Note:** If you have NCTS4 experience,  it is important that you read the NCTS5 service guide and API reference carefully to understand all of the differences between NCTS4 and NCTS5. Reading only the NCTS5 technical interface specification will NOT guide you about all of the differences between the 2 NCTS phases.
