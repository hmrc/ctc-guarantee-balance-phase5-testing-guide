# Test scenarios

Use these scenarios when checking that your software functions correctly for guarantee balance requests and that it is compatible with HMRC systems. For each scenario, check that the response matches the request (requests and responses are expressed in JSON format).

## Scenario 1: Successful balance response

Verify that you receive the expected response with the correct balance and currency when your software issues a successful balance request.

### Request

Use the [Get a balance](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-guarantee-balance/2.0/oas/page#operation/getGuaranteeBalance) endpoint of CTC Guarantee Balance API v2.0 to send a balance request with the following data.

#### GB

```curl
curl -X POST “https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/customs/guarantees/23GB0000010000854/balance” \
-H “Accept: application/vnd.hmrc.2.0+json” \
-H “Content-Type: application/json” \
-d ‘{
 "accessCode": "AC01"
}’
```

#### XI

```curl
curl -X POST “https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/customs/guarantees/23XI0000010000655/balance” \
-H “Accept: application/vnd.hmrc.2.0+json” \
-H “Content-Type: application/json” \
-d ‘{
 "accessCode": "AC01"
}’
```

### Expected response

A successful response should include the following.

#### GB

```json
{
 "balance": 262626,
 "currency": "GBP"
}
```

#### XI

```json
{
 "balance": 30000,
 "currency": "GBP"
}
```

## Scenario 2: Resubmitting balance query within 60 seconds

Verify that you receive a response containing an appropriate error message when your software issues a balance request within 60 seconds of the previous one.

### Request

Use the [Get a balance](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-guarantee-balance/2.0/oas/page#operation/getGuaranteeBalance) endpoint of CTC Guarantee Balance API v2.0 to send a balance request with the following data twice within 60 seconds.

#### GB

```curl
curl -X POST “https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/customs/guarantees/23GB0000010000863/balance” \
-H “Accept: application/vnd.hmrc.2.0+json” \
-H “Content-Type: application/json” \
-d ‘{
 "accessCode": "AC01"

```

#### XI

```curl
curl -X POST “https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/customs/guarantees/23XI0000010000664/balance” \
-H “Accept: application/vnd.hmrc.2.0+json” \
-H “Content-Type: application/json” \
-d ‘{

```

### Expected response

The response to the second query should include the following.

#### GB/XI

```json
{
 "code": "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS",
 "message: "Too many requests."
}
```

## Scenario 3: Invalid GRN

Verify that you receive the expected response with the relevant error information when your software issues a balance request that contains an invalid GRN.

### Request
